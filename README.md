# Hangman Game aka Claude Vibecode Experiment

A simple hangman word guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This started as a quick test about what Claude vibe codes based on a very simple prompt. The entire repo was created in less than 5 minutes, so do not take anything for granted. [A similar experiment exists for Claude](https://github.com/cwBudde/hangman-gemini). It was based on [this screenshot](reference.png), which was generated by Gemini during the process within the strict time frame of 5 minutes. Claude was way faster than Gemini as it sticked closer to the original prompt to create a simple hangman game.
